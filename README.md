EasyHash
========

A simple android application to encode text using: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 and SHA-512.

This application creates a cryptographic hash of text as you type or from shared text.

After you are done entering the text double click on the hash that you want to share with another application. 

You can copy the hash to the clipboard by highlighting itâ€™s text. 

A hash can also be generated by sending text to the application.
